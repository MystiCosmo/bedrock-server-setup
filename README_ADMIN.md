# Minecraft Bedrock Server (Ubuntu Server Setup)

## Overview
This repository provides scripts to fully automate the installation and management of a Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server on Ubuntu Server.  
It is intended for **server administrators** who want reliable startup, automated updates, autosaves, and scheduled restarts.

The setup includes:
- Automatic Bedrock server installation
- Automatic update check & apply at every server startup
- Systemd integration (server runs as a service and restarts on crashes)
- Cron jobs for autosaves (every 5 minutes) and daily restart (midnight)
- CLI management tool (`bedrock-cli.sh`)
